# My LEGO App
Application that allows you to create and manage your LEGO sets and bricks

Work progress tracking in Trello

## Description of the problem:  

> Which sets do I have in my inventory?
> 
> Do I have enough specific bricks to be able to build desired set with proper schematics, do I need to buy a new set or just few specific bricks?
> 
> I have a few old sets that need to be described and cataloged for my own needs - is the set complete or do I have to buy some missing bricks?
> 
> I have a collection of unique set and bricks ex. minifigures. I want to create a catalog consisting of unique bricks and also those I do not have, preferably with suggestions in which official LEGO sets I can find them.
